# Stored Embeddings for Efficient Reinforcement Learning (SEER)

Official codebase for [Improving Computational Efficiency in Visual Reinforcement Learning via Stored Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02886). The Rainbow codebase was originally forked from Kaixhin's [Rainbow](https://github.com/Kaixhin/Rainbow) and the CURL codebase was originally forked from [CURL](https://github.com/MishaLaskin/curl).

# Rainbow + SEER

## Instructions
See instructions in Kaixhin's [Rainbow](https://github.com/Kaixhin/Rainbow). Additional hyperparameters are steps_until_freeze. Example scripts for using large replay buffers (run_lb_alien.sh) and small replay buffers (run_sb_alien.sh) can be found in the scripts folder.

# CURL + SEER

## Instructions
See instructions in [CURL](https://github.com/MishaLaskin/curl). Additional hyperparameters are steps_until_freeze and num_copies. Example scripts for using large replay buffers (run_lb_cartpole.sh) and small replay buffers (run_sb_cartpole.sh) can be found in the scripts folder.
